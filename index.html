</div>
<div class="div3"> <p>The Second Summer of Love, which took over Britain from cities like London and Manchester, soon gave rise to countless subgenres as the 90s became the decade electronic music went big. From Drum & Bass to Jungle and Hardcore, with superstar clubs and high-flying DJs, rave took conquered the world. Lets look at what happened after those formative years of ’88 and ’89, tracing it to the clubs and movements of today. </p></div>

  </div>
<div class="div5"> 
		<p>It’s not as though underground dance culture did not exist in the UK until the acid house explosion of 1988 and ‘89. In fact, there was in fact a rich and varied Eighties club culture. </p></div>

        <p>What criteria does a track need to meet to be considered a rave anthem? Perhaps it's the tune's historical significance in regards to the scene's development or the number of records it sold.

But in reality, the diverse and far-reaching geography of clubland has evolved in such a way over the past 30 odd years that it's somewhat futile order to give the accolade to just a handful of tracks.

Rave anthems are intimate and subjective, varying in size, sound and popularity. It's safe to say that hundreds are produced, reinterpreted, lost and rediscovered with each passing year.

For us, we look at a rave anthem as being the kind of tune that is met with a blatant and recognized roar when it hits the floor. The type of song that makes you shoot up from your disco sit and run full speed into the crowd. It's a track that turns revelers into a linked unit of hedonistic behavior and drives the memories you bring home with you that night.

While a colossal share of the world's most recognized rave anthems from the '90s come from Europe, we decided to narrow our search and concentrate on those that were born and bred in the USA. From NYC's Twisted America Records to LA's City Of Angels imprint, Chicago's Relief Records, Detroit's Transmat and Philadelphia's Ovum Recordings, from sea to shining sea... there are plenty of bangers in the running.

We asked '90s ravers from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York to tell us their favorite underground anthems. With over 400 tracks submitted, these are the 20 that Mixmag connected with the most.

		    <p>Released via Underground Resistance's now defunct World Power Alliance label in 1992, 'The Seawolf' is a trailblazing Detroit techno slammer produced by Jeff Mills that was named after the German u-boats which preyed on allied merchant ships during World War II. The track's frantic sonar-infused sound shows us the dawning of an aggressive techno style that would soon engulf the collective's industrious and mechanical city.</p>

		   <p>"This heavy concoction of breakbeat and acid thought up by DJ Dan and Jim Hopkins (aka Electroliners) was one of the biggest tunes in the LA scene back in 1995. The track samples the late actor Gene Wilder in his iconic roll as Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Yum!</p>

		  <p>Man oh man did this tune cause a ruckus. Released on NYC label Strictly Rhythm in 1995 and recorded at his Ovum Sound Studios in Philadelphia, Josh Wink's hard house meets acidbreaks belter 'Higher State of Consciousness' came into the scene as an extraterrestrial invader and nearly blew the heads off of everyone. The track is commended for taking on some seriously uncharted frequency limits and was a record that everybody wanted to get their hands on.</p>

		   <p>Released on his Relief Records imprint in 1995, the sheer influence of Green Velvet's 'Flash' can be best understood by looking at the immense number of underground icons who have remixed the song. These artists include DJ Sneak, Boo Williams, Paul Johnson, Eats Everything, Latmun, The Advent and more. There is no understating how essential this song was to the midwest rave scene in the mid-90s and it solidified the green haired maestro's place as a dance music kingpin.</p>
